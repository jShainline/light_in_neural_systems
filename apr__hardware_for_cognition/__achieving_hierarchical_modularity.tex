\subsection{Achieving Hierarchical Modularity}
For general networks, the algorithm by which partitions are identified can be made mathematically rigorous from a network theory perspective \cite{oz1992,oz2004}. For the analysis at hand, we consider the partitions of the network we have assigned in the hierarchy. For example ... (minicolumns, mesocolumns, macrocolumns on a wafer(s); multi-columnar modules, ...)

For the scale we seek, passive alignment is required between modules. include scaling figs from ne article here. columns, etc. optical vias 25um pitch enable this. fiber ribbon attach is also required and being developed.
