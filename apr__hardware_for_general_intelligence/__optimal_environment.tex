\subsection{Optimal Environment for Operation}
If it is the case that the physics of our universe permit the existence of optoelectronic cognitive systems far exceeding the scale of the human brain, there is no reason such an entity would prefer to exist in the same environment as life. Biochemistry requires liquid water near 300\,K, but a technological intelligence utilizing semiconductor and superconductor physics is likely to prefer an environment much colder and does not require a planetary atmosphere. It is therefore worthwhile to consider performance of the system in other environments, such as on the dark side of the moon, in the asteroid belt, or in deep space at the temperature of the cosmic microwave background.
