\section{\label{sec:outlook}Outlook}

\begin{itemize}

\item circle back to Turing and von Neumann, their interests in machine intelligence and modeling computation after the brain
\item circle back to digital vs neural, superconducting optoelectronics brings communication and spiking nonlinearities

\item why go to all the trouble?
\begin{itemize}
\item this technology will only be pursued if it can do something that nothing else can do
\item but it can, and what it can do is very important
\begin{itemize}
\item exceptional complexity for experiments in network information, neuroscience models
\item quantum/neural hybrid systems
\item scaling beyond what is possible with other methods, perhaps the smartest machines on the planet
\item computing has shaped economy and society since its inception
\item powerful scientific tool
\item foundational questions about thought and consciousness amongst the most intriguing and important in modern science
\end{itemize}
