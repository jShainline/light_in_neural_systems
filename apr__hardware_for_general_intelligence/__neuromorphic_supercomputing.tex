\begin{itemize}
\item LEDs well heat sinked to contacts, bulk Si substrate. Even though thermal conductivity is low at 4K, there is a lot of material per emitter, and the emitters can operate up to 40\,K, so even if they get hot during bursting, performance is fine
\item JJs are most sensitive to noise, so they should be closest to He at top, and indeed they are, based on the proposed fab flow
\item other source of heat is SPDs, and these are distributed throughout the dendritic tree, so power density remains low
\end{itemize}
