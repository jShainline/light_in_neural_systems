\section{\label{sec:scaling}Large-Scale Optoelectronic Systems}
The goal of this article is to review principles of neural information processing as well as principles of very-large-scale integration and hardware to identify guidelines to inform the design of technology capable of general intelligence. We know that general intelligence relies, in part, on the ability to communicate between large numbers of nodes, so we expect to devise systems with many synapses. We know that silicon microelectronics have been able to advance because the logic and devices are tolerant of imperfections and do not require active adjustments at each device to achieve the necessary bias. In combination, we conclude that we cannot demand exquisite accuracy in fabrication or in control during operation if we aim for large scale. The system must autonomously adapt to find functional operating points.
