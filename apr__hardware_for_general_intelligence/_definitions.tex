Definitions: For the purposes of this article, I define \textbf{\textit{Cognition}} as the act of considering a subject or situation. A \textbf{\textit{Cognitive system}} is an apparatus capable of engaging in cognition. When \textbf{\textit{considering}} a subject or situation, a cognitive system draws insights from learned experiences and sensory inputs and uses that information to form interpretations of the subject. An \textbf{\textit{artificial general intelligence}} is a cognitive system that can draw insight from diverse information sources and use a broad body of knowledge to form a reasoned and comprehensive analysis of the subject under consideration. An artificial general intelligence must be able to learn and plan.
