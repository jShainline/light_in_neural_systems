Definitions: For the purposes of this article, I define \textbf{\textit{Cognition}} as the act of considering a subject or situation. A \textbf{\textit{Cognitive system}} is an apparatus capable of engaging in cognition. When \textbf{\textit{considering}} a subject or situation, a cognitive system draws insights from learned experiences and sensory inputs and uses that information to form interpretations of the subject. An \textbf{\textit{artificial general intelligence}} is a cognitive system that can draw insight from diverse information sources and use a broad body of knowledge to form a reasoned and comprehensive analysis of the subject under consideration. An artificial general intelligence must be able to learn and plan.

\item relaxation oscillator: an element, circuit, or system that produces rapid surges of a physical quantity or signal as the result of a cycle of accumulation and discharge. Relaxation oscillators are energy efficient in that they generally experience a long quiescent period followed by a short burst of activity. Timing between these short pulses can be precisely defined and detected \cite{bu2006}. Relaxation oscillators can operate at many frequencies \cite{huya2000} and engage with myriad dynamical interactions \cite{lued1997}. The oscillator's response is tunable \cite{huya2000}, they are resilient to noise because their signals are effectively digital \cite{stgo2005}, and they can encode information in their mean oscillation frequency as well as in higher-order timing correlations \cite{pasc1999,thde2001,sase2001,stse2007,brcl2010,haah2015}.
