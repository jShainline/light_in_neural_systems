\subsection{\label{sec:memory}Memory in Neural Systems}

Brief discussion of the various forms of memory in neural systems.
\begin{itemize}
\item short-term synaptic/dendritic adaptation
\item auto-associative memory in dynamical states, compare to Hopfield
\item long-term synaptic and dendritic modification
\item growth and decay of neurons
\end{itemize}

On Intelligence
\cite{ha2004}
Hawkins points to four attributes of neocortical memory that differ from digital computing
\begin{itemize}
\item The neocortex stores sequences of patterns
\item The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively
\item The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form
\item The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy
\end{itemize}
