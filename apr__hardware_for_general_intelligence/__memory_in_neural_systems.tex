\subsection{\label{sec:memory}Memory in Neural Systems}

Brief discussion of the various forms of memory in neural systems.
\begin{itemize}
\item short-term synaptic/dendritic adaptation
\item associative memory in dynamical states
\item long-term synaptic and dendritic modification
\item growth and decay of neurons
\end{itemize}
