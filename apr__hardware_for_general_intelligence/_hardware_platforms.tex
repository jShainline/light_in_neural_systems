\section{\label{sec:hardware}Candidate Hardware Platforms for General Intelligence}

\vspace{3em}
It is important to point out that most efforts in neuromorphic hardware do not aspire to achieve general intelligence

\vspace{3em}
I am a proponent of a specific hardware platform, but I also anticipate extraordinary success from multiple hardware platforms. it seems quite likely that we will witness the emergence of a hierarchical intelligent system making use of various magnetic, electronic, and photonic devices. I fully expect a system with general intelligence to employ simpler modules capable of specific intelligence. These may be feed-forward neural networks, recurrent echo state networks or liquid state machines, or more conventional rule-based AI systems. Hardware for general intelligence should be designed with interfaces to modules in mind.

we do not consider all hardware here, most notably we spend little time on memristors or MTJs laregely because in a mture system they will be incorporated with a CMOS platform; they are devices, not platforms for intelligence
